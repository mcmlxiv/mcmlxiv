### Hi there 👋

**Hello! I&#39;m John, a full stack DeFi developer**

Technology I like to use:

My first choice for web development and DeFi apps.

**MERN**  has some excellent features:

- Extensive &amp; current libraries
- Strong support for Solidity and Web3 development
- Enables rapid prototyping
- Facilitates elegant UI design
- Complete set of testing tools and frameworks
- Good community support
- Large pool of skilled developers

**Hardhat, Truffle, Ganache, OpenZeppelin**

I am a fan of both the Hardhat and Truffle suites for the development of Smart Contracts / DApps. Each has some advantages: Hardhat is easy to use, can fork chains quickly, and supports Typescript; Truffle has an elegant UI and some friendly debugging tools. I won&#39;t pick either side in this debate.

I believe in standing on the shoulders of giants. In this case, OpenZeppelin&#39;s smart contract templates and interfaces. Well tested and secure, so they are my go-to to start a project.
